A Java library for working with Table data. 
**tableschema-java** is a library aimed at parsing CSV and JSON-Array documents into a live Java objects according 
to [Table Schema](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/table-schema/), a format definition based on 
[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/).

It allows you to read and write tabular data with assurances to format integrity (it also allows reading and writing
CSV free-form, ie. without a Schema). And finally, it converts Java POJOs to and from CSV, similar to Jackson for JSON 
(mostly).

It was conceived by the guys at [Frictionless Data](frictionlessdata.io)

Please find releases on [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io/#frictionlessdata/tableschema-java)

## Usage

OK, enough of the PR, how do I actually use that thing. It's not like you are the only CSV parser, 
so show me the goods.
- [Reading data](docs/table-reading.md) explains various ways of reading data
  - [Via Java Beans](docs/table-reading.md#reading-tabular-data-the-java-way) for minimal friction 
       if you already have a domain model
  - [Without a Schema](docs/table-reading.md#reading-tabular-data-without-a-schema) Read as String arrays and without 
         format integrity assurance
  - [With a Schema](docs/table-reading.md#reading-tabular-data-using-a-schema) Read as converted Java object arrays with
    format integrity assurance
- [Writing data](docs/table-writing.md) explains various ways of writing data
- [Creating a Schema](docs/creating-schemas.md) shows ways of creating a Table Schema from scratch or from example data
- [Datapackages](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage-java) documentation on Datapackages to distribute 
    data sets as self-contained units
- [Key contraints](docs/key-constraints.md) details ways of working with key constraints
- Validating data: Parsing string data to Field values (casting)
    - [Row Casting](docs/casting.md#row-casting) to check String arrays against a Schema
    - [Field Casting](docs/casting.md#field-casting) to check Strings  against a Field definition
- [Javadoc](docs/javadoc/allclasses-index.html)
